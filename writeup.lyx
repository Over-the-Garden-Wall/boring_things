\begin_layout Title
Event Analysis for Cubist Systemic Strategies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This report represents a cursory investigation of the effect of unspecified
 events on the market behavior of a number of securities.
 I focus exclusively on the effect of these events on adjusted daily returns,
 since this is the variable of primary interest in the development of a
 possible trading strategy surrounding these events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Dataset
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dataset consists of time-series data for 3397 securities over 250 days,
 sampled once per day.
 The time series included for each item are their average daily volume traded,
 market cap, and adjusted daily returns.
 Also included is a classification of the securities into 11 unique groups,
 as well as the timing of unspecified events, which are of primary interest
 to this report.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dataset contains a significant number of NaNs, which are assumed to
 be the result of incomplete or failed collection.
 841 of the 3397 securities contain time series consisting entirely of NaNs,
 and are excluded from any futher analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Events
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Events are indicated by 0s in the /evt array, while other information is
 otherwise unknown to me.
 Included also is the indication that the events may be anticipated 20 days
 in advance, and that the organizer of the data anticipates the influence
 of the events to extend 20 days beyond their occurance.
 There are 4778 unique events in the dataset.

\begin_inset Caption Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Mean and Standard Deviation of returns surrounding event onset.
 The x-axis indicates time in days relative to an event onset, which occurs
 at time 0.
 In computing these curves, outliers with values deviating more than 5 times
 the overall standard deviation of 
\begin_inset Formula $.0257$
\end_inset

 are excluded.
 While the mean signal is approximately 0, there is a large increase in
 volatility associated with event onset.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 1 shows a summary of the behavior of returns surrounding the events.
 At time 0, the returns clearly become much more volatile, suggesting that
 a significant portion the market is responding to the event as it occurs,
 rather than anticipating it as the data suggests is possible.
 I thus predict that any exploitable signal is most likely to occur just
 prior to event onset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Preprocessing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this report, I choose to consider only models that take inputs of fixed
 size for reasons outlined in the Analysis section.
 As such, the data can be preprocessed in a straightforward manner.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A region of interest of 
\begin_inset Formula $t=[-20,\;10]$
\end_inset

 was chosen around each event.
 These times were chosen because they seemed reasonably likely to contain
 usable signals given the gross behavior of the returns mentioned above.
 For each time t surrounding each event, a data vector and label is extracted.
 In cases where two events are close together, this means input-label pairs
 are duplicated, but since they occur at different 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 relative to their respective events, they are never fit in the same model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Labels are defined as +1 or -1, depending on whether the return value is
 positive or negative.
 Instances in which return is NaN or 0 are removed from the dataset.
 An input vector length of 25 was chosen, taken directly from the 25 datapoints
 prior the label.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NaN values in input vectors are set to 0 for convenience, so that models
 need not be designed with the burden of ignoring NaNs taken into account.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I approach this dataset with the plan to first explore basic models and
 build up to more sophisticated models based on any observed patterns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Binary Classification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I've chosen to treat the data as a binary classification problem for several
 reasons.
 Firstly, there's a straightforward policy associated with the binary prediction.
 If the security is predicted to have a positive return, you buy.
 Otherwise, you sell.
 This policy is risk-indifferent, which should be appropriate if the maximum
 amount of capital able to be deployed in exploiting the signal is very
 small relative to the total capital available to the investor.
 Whether or not that is reasonable is information unavailable to me, though
 I would expect that Cubist would not be entirely risk-indifferent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Binary classification is also able to be addressed by a much larger set
 of models.
 The models I use these analyses, however, can all be used for regression,
 which may be a viable future direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
t-Specific Models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The typical approach to time series analysis is to view the data as translationa
lly invariant, or position indifferent.
 That is, the absolute time at which a datapoint arises is irrelevant, what
 matters is the relative time of that datum within the time series.
 Because the time series in the processed dataset are fixed to specific
 times around the events, however, their absolute position is critically
 relevant.
 The best model to predict the return at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t=1$
\end_inset

, for instance, may do very poorly at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=-1$
\end_inset

, since the patterns in the data preceding those times may be completely
 different.
 As such, I build
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Fixed-length Input
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The motivation for this choice is that, at 
\begin_inset Formula $t<5$
\end_inset

 it provides a full field of view for all the points during which the event
 could be anticipated with some additional context prior, without being
 so long as to make model fitting overly burdensome.
